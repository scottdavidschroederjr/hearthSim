# Reflection
This project was the very first thing I made when beginning to learn how to code back in 2021. But you likely just need to look at the brute force and amateur nature of the code to tell you that. Regardless, I'm still proud I was able to take this idea I had sparked by discussions of the monetization practice of Blizzard's TCG, Hearthstone, and bring it to fruition. Although it's incredibly out of date at this point with all the expansions that have happened since its inception, you can still poke around with it via the site hosted by github pages.
